# CS4830 - Exploration 1
##### *Exploration of Python and Django framework for senior web development class at Mizzou*

For a while now, I've been wanting to learn Python, as well as the Django web framework.  This was an assignment for one of my classes at Mizzou, where I basically gave myself a crash-course of the 2 technologies. I had no knowledge of either one before this, so I'm a complete greenhorn! :smiley:

####Python Resources:
If you're new to Python like me, there are a lot of really great resources out there, but I'll just name a few...
- Official Site: https://www.python.org/
- Collection of Good Resources: https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Programmers
  - My personal favorite for getting up and running quickly : http://hetland.org/writing/instant-python.html
- Python wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)
- Codecademy: https://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/python

####Further Investigation:
I looked into various Python frameworks, content management systems, etc..., but I eventually settled on learning Django...
- Flask (micro web framework): http://flask.pocoo.org
- DjangoCMS (python CMS): http://www.django-cms.org/en/
- Plone CMS (another python CMS): https://plone.org
- **_Django_** (meatier web framework): https://www.djangoproject.com (also see http://www.fullstackpython.com/django.html )
- Plenty of others out there: https://www.python.org/about/apps/#web-and-internet-development + http://www.fullstackpython.com/other-web-frameworks.html

I did a little research on good IDEs for Python development, and one that several people recommended was PyCharm: http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/ (feel free to suggest others!).
There are also Python plugins/modes available for Eclipse, Emacs, and many others...

Next, I installed Django on my VM and set up a SQLite database: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-the-django-web-framework-on-ubuntu-14-04. This tutorial also gives some good info on setting up a simple django project.  Then, I configured Apache and Django to play nicely (with this great tutorial: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-serve-django-applications-with-apache-and-mod_wsgi-on-ubuntu-14-04 .

####Python First Impressions: 
So far, I have really enjoyed working with Python, as it seems to be a very powerful and versatile language.
I like that it can be used as an Object-Oriented language, a functional language, a procedural language-- pretty much anything you want.
The syntax is simple and easy to learn, but also powerful and flexible.
I even heard a few days back that it is currently the 4th most widely used programming language in the world, so why not learn it? 
I look forward to playing around with it more in the days/weeks ahead.  

So, this currently boring (but functioning! :) ) Django app is now running at http://jbrenn.me 

####Next Steps:
Now that I’ve got Django properly running, I can start playing around with Python and seeing if Django really helps to build web apps as quickly as it promises.  I’ll probably be going through the official tutorial at https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/intro/tutorial01/ , which creates a site for people to view and vote in polls, with an admin side to manage the polls and such.  I’ll try to update my progress here from time to time if I remember.  Let the games begin!
